Working Groups
for Public Science

These are small, self-started groups for 
investigating some area of interest and sharing
research, examples and ideas.

Within this repo is a folder for a different area
of research, with subdirectories that include 
material on the given subject. 

Our current working groups include:

Ideas for future working groups should be added to this readme!

Or, clone the repo, add the directory, and push!
